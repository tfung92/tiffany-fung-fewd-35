#Lesson 12 - Arrays and Loops

In Lesson 12, we're moving into more applied programming techniques with the introduction of arrays and loops. These are foundational concepts used across almost every programming language. They are a bit weird to see without prior programming knowledge but you'll quickly harness their power to make use of a computer's vast abilities to fly through data comparisons and computations.

##Agenda

* jQuery Plugins review + coding exploration session
* Array Lesson
* Array Codealong Lab
* Loops Lesson
* For vs While
* Using loops

##Objectives

By the end of this class, you will:

* Understand how loops work
* Have a grasp of using arrays and loops together
* Experimented with jQuery plugins
* Should have a fairly good grasp on using jQuery and JS now
