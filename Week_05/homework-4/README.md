# FEWD Week #4: Custom Website

### Description

Relaxr was really impressed by your work last week and wants you to continue development on their landing page. (This will be a new page!)

Starting in class, you will work to build out a more complex layout for their company site. They decided on creating a blog, and their back-end engineers will be focused on developing the blog's functionality. They want your front-end skills to style their designs using HTML and CSS so Relaxr's engineers can begin integrating. Once again, the designers have handed you a basic [design file with instructions](design_files/design_file.txt) and the JPEG below to help you bring the blog to life. Submit the finished version for homework.

### Real-World Applications

- Build websites with multi-column layouts
- Turn complex design assets into code
- Style text on your page with Google Fonts

### Technical Requirements

- Use in-line-block or floats in your CSS to achieve a two-column layout
- Use the correct ```Open Sans``` Google Font typeface to style the text denoted in the design file, according to the JPEG provided
- Use proper filename conventions (lowercase, .html)
- Use a single external CSS stylesheet to style all pages
- Use a background image for the headers
- Add a hover effect to all the links using pseudo-classes
- Integrate drop caps using pseudo-classes

### Bonus
- Make this page responsive by having the right-hand column display below the left-hand column on smaller (phone-sized) screens.
- Up for a real challenge? Use ```<script>``` tags in your HTML and [read ahead](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/) to make a dialogue box pop up when a user clicks "Sign Up Now!" that reads "We're Not Ready For Sign-Ups...Yet."
